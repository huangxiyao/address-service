Proxy Bundle Installer
----------------------
The proxy bundle installer contains all the configuration and scripts necessary to
configure the MDCP proxy tier.  This installer takes 2 parameters:

-d which sets the directory to extract the files into
-e which sets the environment specific configuration

The default configuration is currently set to the development-diet configuration.  If the 
individual running the installer doesn't pass the -e argument, then it will use the
DEV-DIET configuration.

Based on the environment configuration, the installer will symbolically link the correct
directory.

In the file below, the SWH team places an httpd.conf file.

/opt/webhost/local/WHA-General-Inst/apache/conf

In order to have these apache configuration files participate in the SWH configuration, 
this file should include all the files in the following location:

/opt/casfw/mdcp-proxy-bundle/conf.d/*.conf

This is done using the "Include" directive:

Include /opt/casfw/mdcp-proxy-bundle/conf.d/*.conf
