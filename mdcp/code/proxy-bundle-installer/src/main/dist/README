Proxy Bundle Installer
----------------------
The proxy bundle installer contains all the configuration and scripts necessary to
configure the MDCP proxy tier.  This installer takes 2 parameters:

-d which sets the directory to extract the files into
-e which sets the environment specific configuration

The default configuration is currently set to the development-diet configuration.  If the 
individual running the installer doesn't pass the -e argument, then it will use the
DEV-DIET configuration.

Based on the environment configuration, the installer will symbolically link the correct
directory.

The following Apache configuration files must be updated in order for this bundle
configuration to be taken into account:

1) /opt/webhost/local/WHA-General-Inst/apache/conf/httpd.conf

If not present yet append the following line to the file above:

Include /opt/casfw/proxy-bundle/etc/conf.d/httpd-*.conf

2) /opt/webhost/local/WHA-General-Inst/apache/conf/ssl.conf

If not present yet append the following line to the file above:

Include /opt/casfw/proxy-bundle/etc/conf.d/ssl-*.conf
